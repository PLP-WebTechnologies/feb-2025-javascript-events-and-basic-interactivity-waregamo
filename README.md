"THis was week6 Description"
You will create a functional webpage that demonstrates the following JavaScript concepts:
Use event listeners effectively.
Implement form validation.
Add interactive elements.





       "This is what i have done"
HTML Structure: The HTML file contains a simple form with fields for name and email, along with error message spans and a submit button.
CSS Styles: The CSS file styles the form and error messages, making it visually appealing.
JavaScript Functionality:
An event listener is added to the form to handle the submit event.
The form validation checks if the name and email fields are filled out and if the email is in a valid format.
If validation fails, appropriate error messages are displayed.
If validation is successful, a success message is shown, and the form is reset
